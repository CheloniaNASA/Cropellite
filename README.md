Welcome to the GitHub repository for NASA Space Apps 2024's team Chelonia. We chose the [Leveraging Earth Observation Data for Informed Agricultural Decision-Making](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/nasa-space-apps-2024/challenges/leveraging-earth-observation-data-for-informed-agricultural-decision-making/) challenge.

We propose a mobile application to help particular farmers and agricultural companies efficiently control their crops. By applying AI and ML techniques to satellite images, we intend to provide accurate information about:

- Irrigation needs for crops
- Weather predictions
- Possible land intrusions
- Estimate land value
- Compute water stress
- Compute soil organic carbon

In this repository, you can find the Python implementation for the neural network that identifies areas with irrigation needs.
